# CSE422 Project

## Overview
This project explores data processing, visualization, and modeling techniques to derive insights and build predictive models. The key steps include data cleaning, visualization, and preprocessing, focusing on converting categorical data into numerical representations for further analysis.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing or irrelevant data by intentional dropping.
- **Data Visualization:** Provides insights into quantitative aspects of the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Encodes categorical variables into numerical values for compatibility with machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements logistic regression and decision tree models for predictive analytics.
